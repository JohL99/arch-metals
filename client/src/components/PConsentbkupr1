                You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before
                you decide whether to participate, it is important for you to
                understand why the research is taking place and what it will
                involve. Please take the time to read the following information
                carefully and feel free to ask us if you would like more
                information or if there is anything that you do not understand.
                We would like to stress that you do not have to accept this
                invitation and should only agree to take part if you want to. An
                underlying premise in extending the invitation to participate in
                the research project is that you either prepare or use commodity
                price forecast frequently in your work environment. If this
                assumption is not correct, please indicate “No” on the
                Registration Page and decline the opportunity to participate in
                the research project. Thank you for reading this.

                facing mining organizations is how they can more reliable
                forecast commodity price levels consistently to support planning
                and improve the sustainability of the industry. The intention of
                this research is to determine if co-opting industry experts to
                participate in constructing an understanding of the anticipated
                future commodity price levels with other industry participants,
                including shared through panel discussion, they can jointly
                surface factors influencing expected commodity price levels to
                reduce the future uncertainty for all participants involved in
                the research panel."

                Participants in this study include industry experts within the
                mining industry, financial institutions and market research
                organizations who regularly prepare commodity price forecasts as

                chosen because of your experience within the natural resource
                industry. On the basis that the nature of the research study
                closely mirrors the participant’s professional responsibilities
                in using or making commodity price forecasts, it is expected
                participation in the research panel will require minimal
                additional time from the industry experts invited to
                participate. The assumption is that amongst the task you
                regularly undertake is making commodity price forecasts, should
                this not be part of your skill set, please indicate “No” on the
