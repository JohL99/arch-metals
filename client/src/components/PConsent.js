                You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before
                you decide whether to participate, it is important for you to
                understand why the research is taking place and what it will
                involve. Please take the time to read the following information
                carefully and feel free to ask us if you would like more
                information or if there is anything that you do not understand.
                We would like to stress that you do not have to accept the
                invitation and should only agree to take part if you want to. An 
		            underlying premise in extending the invitation to participate in 
		            the research project is that you either prepare or use metal price 
		            forecasts in your working environment or you follow commodities 
		            and have insights into emerging market dynamics. If this assumption 
		            is not correct, please indicate “No” on the Registration Page and 
		            decline the opportunity to participate in the research project.

                A perennial problem facing mining organizations is how they can more 
                reliably forecast metal prices to consistently support their planning
                and improve their sustainability. The intention of the research project 
		            aims to explore if co-opting mining industry professionals to participate 
		            in in making metal price forecasts alongside their industry peers, 
		            and jointly surface insights about expected metal prices to reduce the 
		            price uncertainty for all participants involved in the research project."

                chosen because of your experience within or to the natural resource

                participation in the research panel will require minimal
                additional time from participants (approximately 30 mintutes per month). 
		            An assumption is that amongst the actions you regularly undertake is

                reforecasting metal price estimates, with the ongoing results

                research project will help inform the professional practice of 
                the participants in future. The research project could also serve
