                You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before
                you decide whether to participate, it is important for you to
                understand why the research is taking place and what it will
                involve. Please take the time to read the following information
                carefully and feel free to ask us if you would like more
                information or if there is anything that you do not understand.
                We would like to stress that you do not have to accept this
                invitation and should only agree to take part if you want to. An
                underlying premise in extending the invitation to participate in
                the research project is that you either prepare or use commodity
                price forecast frequently in your work environment. If this
                assumption is not correct, please indicate “No” on the
                Registration Page and decline the opportunity to participate in
                the research project. Thank you for reading this.

                facing mining organizations is how they can more reliable
                forecast metal price levels consistently to support planning
                and improve the sustainability of the industry. The intention of
                this research is to determine if co-opting industry experts to
                participate in exploring an understanding of the anticipated
                forecasted metal prices with other industry participants,
                through consensus panel interactions, they can jointly
                surface insights about expected metal price levels to
                reduce the price uncertainty for all participants involved in
                the research project."

                mining organizations, financial institutions and market research
                organizations who regularly prepare or use metal price forecasts as

                chosen because of your experience within the natural resource

                closely mirrors the participant’s professional responsibilities
                in using or making metal price forecasts, it is expected
                participation in the research panel will require minimal
                additional time from the industry experts invited to
                participate. The assumption is that amongst the actions you

                this not be part of your experiences, please indicate “No” on the

                experts in the natural resource sector. As the research project

                reforecasting metal price estimates, with the ongoing results
                continuously shared with all panel participants, it is hoped the
                research project will help inform the professional practice of 
                the participants in future. The research project could also serve
		as a precursor to a similar project by an industry association on
