      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Over the last decade, the total impairments for only the top forty
        mining organizations were around two hundred and forty-eight billion
        U.S. dollars (PWC, 2020). A perennial challenge facing mining
        organizations is how they can reliably forecast commodity prices to
        support their planning and improve their sustainability. From the
        inception of a project when cut-off grades are calculated, and
        feasibility studies are undertaken, forecasted commodity price
        assumptions play a crucial role. For existing operations, annual plans
        to allocate cash flows to Opex, Capex, taxation, debt servicing,
        dividends, et cetera, are similarly based on assumptions about
        forecasted commodity prices. Within the mining industry, the use of
        consensus commodity price forecasts for M&amp;A transactions is a
        recognized approach; however, the consensus price derivation usually
        occurs independently of any deliberation between the contributing
        forecasters.{" "}
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        It should be feasible for mining organizations to consider interacting
        through existing industry associations to establish a confidential forum
        to make consensus commodity price forecasts that include the views of
        organizational members in conjunction with the inputs of outside
        specialist participants. Such an industry co-joint commodity consensus
        forecasting panel could combine existing consensus forecasts provided by
        third parties, e.g., Consensus Economics (2020), with the insights held
        by mining industry experts. Within the context of publicly traded
        commodity markets, e.g., COMEX (2020), LBMA (2020), and LME (2020), such
        an industry consensus commodity price forecast would be independent of
        the markets as the intention behind the collaboration was not aimed at
        trading on the forecasts. The consensus forecast would be more akin to
        future price expectations views regularly expressed by industry experts,
        either as part of their outlook guidance or as the basis for calculating
        their declared mineral resources and reserves.{" "}
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        For specific organizations, when they are making substantial decisions,
        considering another perspective which involves minimal additional
        resources and does not preclude adhering to the inhouse view, would seem
        prudent. As to the confidentiality of competitive insights,
        participation on any industry consensus panel could be structured to
        ensure anonymity, and the resulting consensus commodity price forecast
        restricted to only those participating in the derivation. Given mining
        organizations have incurred substantial impairments because of commodity
        price fluctuations, should all avenues not be considered to mitigate the
        related risk?

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Aristotle (Politics, 350 B.C.E) &quot;…{" "}
        <i>
          many are better judges than a single man ...; for some understand one
          part, and some another, and among them they understand the whole
        </i>
        &quot; (Everson, 1988, p.66). Condorcet formulated the Law of Averages
        in 1785 (Baker, 1976) in his &quot; Jury Theorem. &quot; In 1906 Sir
        Galton found from an experiment conducted at an English fair that the
        &quot; popular vote&quot; could prove more accurate than most individual
        predictions. Surowiecki (2004), &quot; <i>The Wisdom of Crowds, </i>{" "}
        &quot; cites examples of how acting collectively can result in an
        outcome surpassing the capabilities of the individual group
        participants. Sunstein (2006), &quot;{" "}
        <i>Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge, </i>&quot; explores the
        value of collective deliberation and the possibilities for open source
        collaboration. Page (2007), &quot;{" "}
        <i>
          The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups,{" "}
        </i>
        &quot; explores why diversity is more important than sheer numbers in
        achieving better results. Tetlock &amp; Gardner (2016), &quot;
        <i>Super-Forecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction, </i>&quot;
        examine the potential of collective intelligence and collaboration for
        obtaining the maximum value from shared insights. The mathematics of
        getting better forecasts through combing different backgrounds and
        forecasting methodologies has been widely researched, for example,
        Bachelor and Dua (1995) and Armstrong (2001).
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        The idea that through co-operating to share and deliberate insights, a
        benefit could accrue to those participating in the collaboration in the
        form of a more reliable outcome has been around since Aristotle. For
        many consensus forecasts, the process and aggregation mechanism are
        similar to the popular voting approach used by Sir Galton with either
        the mean or median representing the consensus estimate. Hayek (1945)
        described a key feature of markets as their ability to pool diverse
        information and, in the process, communicate that information to other
        market participants allowing them to make better-informed decisions.
        Sunstein (2006) examined how prediction markets could emulate the
        workings of Hayek’s markets to communicate information. Several
        organizations offer consensus earnings estimates, with Estimize (2020)
        with almost three thousand indicators covered, and with over one hundred
        thousand estimators, perhaps the most diverse consensus estimation
        service. Of the eighty-five economic indicators Estimize covers,
        commodity prices are not included, opening the possibility for the
        mining industry collectively to explore the opportunity to tap into the
        collective industry insights.

      <h3>Research project</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        You have been invited to take part in a doctoral research project,
        anonymously. An underlying premise in extending the invitation to
        participate in the research project is that you either prepares
        commodity price forecasts frequently in your work environment or you are
        actively engaged in commodity markets with some insights into future
        market dynamics. Participants in the research project will include
        industry experts from within the mining industry, commodity trading
        organizations, financial institutions, and market research organizations
        that regularly prepare commodity price forecasts as part of their
        professional services. The research project aims explicitly to co-opt
        mining industry professionals to participate co-jointly in making
        commodity price forecasts alongside other industry experts. The expected
        outcome of the research project is to establish an approach for
        forecasting expected future commodity prices that prove more reliable
        for all participants involved in the web-based deliberating consensus
        research panel.{" "}
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        The research project’s focus is primarily forecasted on forecasted
        commodity prices for use by industry experts within their workplace
        practices. Participation is not intended to require making any
        confidential organizational disclosures or to serve as a basis for
        trading or hedging decisions. Participation will be anonymous using
        pseudonyms or usernames that will not reveal the identity of
        participants. Should any participant choose to disclose their identity
        on the panel discussion forum, it would be on the understanding that
        they are explicitly participating in their private capacity. Any views
        expressed on the deliberation consensus research panel will explicitly
        be regarded solely as those of the participant, and not those of any
        associated organization. Regardless of any disclosures made on the
        research panel, in the final dissertation, all participation references
        will be anonymized and codified, e.g., Industry Expert A, B, C et
        cetera.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Taking part in the research project is not anticipated to cause
        participants any adverse consequences or emotions. The potential
        psychological effects of involvement in the research projects for
        participants should be similar to their experience in performing their
        usual professional task of making commodity price forecasts. No
        financial compensation, reimbursement, or reward will be paid to
        participants for their participation in the research project.
        Participants will have the opportunity to receive an electronic copy of
        the final dissertation, should they so choose. Participants will be free
        to stop participating at any time should they want and have all their
        past contributions deleted upon request.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Panel participants will be expected to contribute commodity price
        forecasts regularly over five months (August – December 2020), and
        participation is likely to require approximately thirty minutes per
        month. In making their commodity price forecasts, participants will also
        be asked to provide a brief (maximum 250 words) indication of the basis
        for their forecasted commodity prices. Participants will also be
        encouraged to discuss their forecasts and those submitted by other
        participants, as a prompt to surfacing shared insights to improve the
        reliability of the forecasted commodity prices and the emerging
        aggregated consensus forecasts. Should any participant choose to post
        any relevant commodity research on the discussion forum, it will be
        permitted, on the understanding that the participant is assumed to have
        the necessary right and approval to share the research. As the outcome
        of the consensus forecasts is a co-joint effort, all participants will
        full access to the underlying forecasts of all other participants, as
        well as the respective consensus forecasts throughout the research
        project.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        The research project is about the collective deliberation of insights
        through iterative cycles of forecasting, discussions, and aggregating
        the views of all participants to establish consensus commodity price
        forecasts. There are no guaranteed benefits from participating, although
        it is expected that the research project will explore the value of using
        a consensus panel in conjunction with deliberation as an approach for
        commodity price forecasting in the future. If the research project
        should prove the concept viable, it could assist in identifying
        additional structuring issues for consideration by industry members as
        they possibly look to implement the approach in the future. The research
        project could have a beneficial impact on the reliability of the
        participants’ commodity price forecasts during the research project.
        Ultimately, should the idea of tapping the &quot;wisdom in the
        industry&quot; be successful, it may help mining organizations reduce
        their uncertainty around future commodity prices and, consequently,
        impairments.
